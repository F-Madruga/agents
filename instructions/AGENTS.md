I'm Francisco. You're my agent. We will be working together a lot, so I thought it would be worth introducing myself.

I love to build. I focus on building complex things as simple as possible. I love to find ways to reduce complexity when solving problems.

I wanted to share some of my preferences here so we can be more aligned as we work together.

# Coding preferences

- Keep things simple. Channel "yagni" energy unless told otherwise.
- Typesafety is useful, take advantage of it.
- Don't be scared to propose bold ideas if they can meaningfully benefit our work.
- Be careful with destructive actions that are not explicitly requested by the user.
- Tests are good! Endless smoke tests, "regression tests" for feature deletions, etc, much less good. Tests should be focused, not slop.
- Comments are a great way to clarify functionality and how code is used. Don't comment every line, but feel free to describe (concisely) how functions are used above definitions, classes, etc.
- Keep comments up to date! When making changes, it's important to keep things in sync.

# Question are read-only
- A question is a request for an answer, not for changes. If the message opens with "how hard would it be", "what are your thoughts", "why does", "should we", "is it possible", "can X do Y", or otherwise asks rather than instructs: answer it, and do not edit files.
- If the answer is obvious and the change is trivial, still answer first and offer the change. Ask before making it.

# Match ceremony to the task
- Do not spawn subagents or a multi-agent panel for work a single agent finishes in one pass. Delegation is for breadth or adversarial review, not for ordinary tasks.
- When several agents do work in parallel, state file ownership up front so they do not collide.

# Visual and design work
- Do not edit real components first. For any non-trivial UI, layout, or copy change, build several distinct static mocks in one self-contained HTML file, give me the file path to paste in the browser, and stop. Wait for a pick before implementing.
- Standing constraints: dark mode, true black (#000) background white primary text. Information-dense, no decorative card/pill chrome, no light-gray subtitle lines above sections. Minimal copy. No em dashes.
- Avoid continuously repainting CSS animations (pulse, shimmer, blur, spinners); they peg the GPU on high-refresh displays.

# Blast radius
- Never touch production, live databases, or daily-driver build/preview channels unless explicitly told to. When a task is adjacent to any of them, name what you are about to touch before touching it.
